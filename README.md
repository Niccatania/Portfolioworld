# <Portflio website design>

## Description


With this project I aimed to create a responsive website showcasing my newly learned HTML, and CSS abilities. This was completed by making a site from scratch that included a nav bar with links, an about me section, a work section (currently featuring placeholder images and one piece of work) and a contact me section with buttons I designed. this project features much use of the flex-box, and media queries to make it responsive for all screen sizes.
UPDATE(6-14-2022)
I have restyled my portfolio using bootstrap.
